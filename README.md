# Solar-Panel-Predictive-Maintenance-Project
This project entitled "Solar Panel Predictive Maintenance". The purpose of the project is to build a classification model on Inverter Efficiency. The classifier will have to be able to predict if a solar panel has no failure and therefore no maintenance is needed or not.

# Problem Statement
- Electricity plays a crucial role in manufacturing operations.
- 50% of energy costs attributed to electrical power (Matthes et al. 2018).
